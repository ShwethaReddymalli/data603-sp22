# Is MapReduce becoming obsolete or is the Spark replacing it?

MapReduce is a programming language used in the Hadoop Distributed File system. This is widely used for Big Data and helps in writing the applications that run in parallel to process large volumes of data stored on clusters. Though this language has a higher level of scalability and reduces storage cost, over a period this is being replaced or considered as an outdated programming model. Did the competition in the market in respect to various solutions for Big Data challenges make the legacy languages go outdated? *Is this the reason why we are not using much MapReduce in our course too?* Did the evolution of Apache Spark have an impact on Map Reduce or the low-level programming which needs a developer to write lots of code made it difficult to adopt and hence the Spark took over the storm of MapReduce. Though MapReduce is better suited to handle big data that does not fit in the memory and has many advantages over Spark, why are we choosing to adopt Spark as the model instead of MapReduce? During my assignment for this week, even me as a person using MapReduce felt it is difficult to implement in writing the code. 

Did Spark replace MapReduce, and this is what I will be covering in my research paper. I have referred many links while doing my previous week's homework and I would like to understand both MapReduce and Spark through this research hoping I understand my course better. I referred to various links and articles before I pick this topic for my research. I will be attaching the references too that helped me in picking up this topic. If itâ€™s not outdated, then are we going to see updated see more of MR in coming years of Big Data, or are we going to see it being completely erased for the newer technological generations in Big Data.
