# Is MapReduce becoming obsolete or is the Spark replacing it?

## ABSTRACT


In the world of advancements in every field and every study, the section of Big Data and its frameworks are also evolving based on the requirements of the users and to make sure that they are maintained to be user friendly. Choosing the right one from the multiple frameworks available is always a crucial decision that needs to be made by user. We are going to compare two big frameworks in big data, that are MapReduce and Apache Spark. We will evaluate the major features of each cluster computing frameworks based on similar situations and understand the reasons why one of these is being replaced by the other one. Further in this paper we will look at the architecture of the frameworks, their advantages, disadvantages, application in the real time world of big data and analyze the importance of both programming languages. In addition to that, the word of MapReduce being obsolete or outdated will also be answered based of various short term and long-term scenarios and transitions.
