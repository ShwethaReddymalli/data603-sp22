# Database

## NonSQL Databases:
The limitations of SQL databases such as horizontal scaling of relational databases, delay in reflecting the data written in one node to other nodes and dealing with the unstructured data such as email messages, photos, videos etc. has laid ways for the evolution of NonSQL database. As the term itself mentions, these databases do not use SQL for managing the data. There are few operational data models such as *key-value store, Columnar, Document and Graph database*. All these databases strive to maximize availability at the expense of consistency. These models are a better choice for semi-structured and unstructured data. 
Key-value databases are highly performant, efficient and scalable which are usually used for caching, message querying and session management. Columnar databases are like traditional databases; however, the columns are stored in separate region or file in system's storage rather than being grouped into tables. Document oriented databases have a unique identifier and itself serves as the value. Graph databases is considered as a subcategory of document store model, expect for these add an extra layer by highlighting the relationship between individual documents.

## Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses:
To overcome the limitations of data warehouses, data lakes came into existence. Usually, data lakes support all the data types such as structured, semi and unstructured data. This is comparatively less expensive than that of data warehouses. These models have open formats and have scalability that can hold any amount of data at low cost, irrespective of the data type. However, these are limited to data scientists and has low performance rate, hence, to overcome the limitations of data lakes, *data lakehouses* are developed which provides high quality and reliable data. This also promotes high performance and provides simplicity which supports broader use cases of a data lake.
